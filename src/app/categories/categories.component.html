              On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text,
              that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand
              times and everything that was left from its origin would be the
              word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
              to its own, safe country. A small river named Duden flows by their
              place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
              paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly
              into your mouth.
